# SpaceshipPrototype:
This is a prototype loosely based off of Galactica. The user shoots at the different enemies and then there is a chance that the enemy will drop powerups. The game has a shield powerup, blaster powerup, and a spread blaster powerup. The ship has a total of 5 blaster spots, but it can only have one type of blaster.
